Hi, I'm Tim :D Nice to meet you! I'm entering my 4th year of studying computer science, and I enjoy exploring the continuity between my major and visual design (graphic design, UI/UX, frontend). My interests include geography, architecture, embroidery, and staying active. Excited to meet everyone this summer!
