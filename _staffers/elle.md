Hi everyone! I’m Elle, a rising 4th year studying Design and IEOR and minoring in EECS. I love art, astrology, taking care of houseplants, crystals, and making playlists :) I’m also passionate about the intersection of design and social good. Looking forward to a great summer and I’m excited to work with you all!
